The ministries of Telecom and Information and Broadcasting have agreed to use over 200 MHz spectrum earmarked for broadcasting services, the majority of which is with Doordarshan, for advance mobile services.
“Doordarshan may not need entire spectrum between 470—698 MHz. Once ITU decides it to be allocated for mobile services in the Asian region, DoT will pitch for it to be deployed for wireless broadband services,” an official source told PTI.
“India has already represented at World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC) through DoT to get this band for mobile services,” the official added.
The official said the I&B and Telecom ministries have aligned to use this spectrum band for mobile services.
“This is first time both ministries smoothly agreed on spectrum. The decision was conveyed to the delegation in ITU on November 24. If we are firm on this band for mobile services now, the ecosystem will take around 5—8 years to develop,” the official said.
Early this year, the spectrum auction of about 380 MHz airwaves across various bands fetched government bids worth Rs 1.1 lakh crore.
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a body under the United Nations, coordinates with countries to allocate spectrum for various technologies.
However, ITU could not approve usage of this spectrum for advance mobile services as Iran objected to interference in services from Pakistan. Pakistan, in turn, was opposed to its use in India, a member of the India delegation, who did not wish to be named, said.
A big chunk of spectrum in 450 MHz band in India is marked for broadcast services, including over 100 MHz spectrum between 585 MHz—698 MHz. Part of this is also being used by other government agencies.
Doordarshan has vacated 700 MHz band spectrum, which the government is planning to auction now. To give you a perspective, France, which is around one—fifth of India’s size, recently realised about USD 2.98 billion from the auction of 30 MHz of paired frequency.
In Brazil, the 450 MHz band is being used for 4G services at a very low cost, especially at locations where the population is less. The technology is still being evolved to address issues like interference.
It has the potential to support a boom in machine-to-machine communication like real—time surveillance using wireless video camera and transmission of health record automatically to hospitals.
“At WRC, India supported inclusion of 470—698 MHz for international mobile telecommunications (IMT) service area. It is a good step forward, especially for broadband coverage in rural areas,” COAI Director General Rajan S Mathews said.
“Now, the world knows India’s stand. We will see companies approaching us for developing its ecosystem here.”

No-frills airline AirAsia India saw its net loss widen to nearly Rs 65 crore in the three months ended September 2015 even as revenues rose during the same period.
In the year-ago period, the carrier — which began operations last year — had a net loss of nearly Rs 25 crore.
The airline — a three-way joint venture between Malaysia’s AirAsia Berhard, Tata Sons and Arun Bhatia’s Telestra Tradeplace — has been facing stiff competition in the domestic market.
According to latest financial numbers announced by AirAsia Berhard, its associate company — AirAsia India — recorded a net loss of nearly Rs 65 crore in the latest September quarter.
“AirAsia India recorded a net loss of RM41.3 million (quarter ended September 30, 2014: RM15.7 million) in the quarter under review (July—September 2015) out of which RM29.7 million is equity accounted in the AirAsia Berhad income statement,” the Malaysian carrier said.
Based on the exchange rate of nearly Rs 64 for one Malaysian Ringgit (RM), the latest September quarter’s net loss translates to nearly Rs 65 crore. For the year—ago period, the figure would be Rs 25 crore.
In a filing to the Malaysian stock exchange last week, AirAsia Berhard said that as the Group’s interest in AirAsia India has been reduced to zero in accordance with MFRS128, “any profits will only be recognised when a total of RM11.5 million of unrecognised losses have been reversed”.
The financial statement has been made as per MFRS128, an accounting norm for investments in associates, permitted by the Malaysian Accounting Standards Board.
The Indian carrier’s net loss widened in the latest September quarter even as its revenues rose on the back of flying more number of passengers and higher average fare.
“AirAsia India recorded revenue of Rs 1,312 billion in 3Q15, compared to the Rs 0.6 billion achieved in 3Q14 as operations commenced in June 2014.
“The number of passengers carried increased 225 per cent which contributed to a unit passenger revenue of Rs 3,154.
Ancillary income per passenger was at Rs 470 while the seat load factor was 76 per cent,” the filing said.
In the September 2015 quarter, AirAsia India carried 4,16,182 passengers, much higher than 1,28,089 people flown in the year—ago period.
The average fare rose to Rs 2,684 in the latest September quarter compared to Rs 1,496 in the year—ago period, the filing said.
At the end of September 2015, the carrier had five aircraft while the number of flights stood at 3,032.

Reliance Industries is facing a 40 per cent cut in the marketing margin it charges on selling its KG—D6 gas to fertilizer and LPG plants after the government notified a ceiling of Rs 200 per thousand standard cubic meters (scm).
RIL was charging $0.135 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) as margin to hedge marketing risks on sale of its eastern offshore KG—D6 gas. This is over and above the gas price of $ 4.24 per mmBtu.
Pursuant to the Cabinet decision of November 18, fixing a maximum marketing margin that firms can charge on selling all domestically produced natural gas to fertilizer and LPG plants, the Oil Ministry has issued a Gazette notification fixing the levy at “a maximum of Rs 200 per thousand scm (on Net Calorific Value of 10,000 Kcal/scm).”
The marketing margin being fixed at NCV basis on 10,000 kilocalorie (Kcal) will at current foreign exchange rate translate into a levy of $ 0.79—0.8 per mmBtu, Ministry officials said.
Had the government fixed the margin at 8,300 Kcal, the margin would have come to $0.85 per mmBtu.
Marketing margin charged on gas produced from stateowned Oil and Natural Gas Corp’s (ONGC) fields is Rs 200 per thousand scm and will not be changed following the notification.
But for RIL, there will be a 40 per cent cut as all of its 11—12 million standard cubic meters per day of KG—D6 gas is sold to fertilizer plants.
The “decision will be effective from the date of Cabinet approval i.e. November 18, 2015,” the notification said.
The Oil Ministry had in December 2013, gave freedom to gas retailers including RIL and GAIL (India) to fix the marketing margin they want to charge on sale of natural gas to consumers other than urea manufacturing units and LPG plants.
It had decided that the government needs to regulate the marketing margin for supply of domestic gas to urea and LPG producers, as the same had implications on the government’s subsidy outgo. Both urea and LPG are subsidised.
GAIL markets gas produced from ONGC fields.
Sector regulator Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) was asked to suggest the marketing margin for the same. PNGRB recommended the range of Rs 150—200 per thousand scm.
“In future, escalation in the limit of marketing margin up to Wholesale Price Index (WPI) may be done by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas itself. The escalation would be subject to the upper limit of WPI inflation prevailing at relevant point of time,” the notification said.
For escalating the marketing margin beyond this limit, the Ministry “would require the approval of Cabinet through Department of Expenditure,” it added.

India is expected to see an unprecedented boom in the number of Internet users over the next few years but for a host of Internet companies it means a wholesale change in the language in which they engage with their potential new consumers.
According to a November report by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IMAI), India is expected to have the second largest Internet user base in the world by the middle of next year with about 460 million users. The numbers have grown by 49 per cent over the past year and about three-quarter of these new users are accessing the net through mobile phones.
Behind these numbers though, is a more interesting trend, namely that the Indian Internet consumer is now a very different individual than he or she was a few years ago.

Smaller towns

According to an earlier IMAI-BCG report, while 29 per cent of Internet users lived in rural areas; in 2018 approximately half the users will reside in smaller towns and villages and will access the Internet not in English but through local languages.
The anomaly here is that the Internet in India is predominantly English – the English language still accounts for 56 per cent of the content on the worldwide Web, while Indian languages account for less than 0.1 per cent. There is a dearth of good regional language content that the new Indian Internet user can engage with. However, over the next few years this could change rapidly as companies are investing heavily in building up the Indian language Internet.

Google initiative

According to a spokesperson from Internet giant Google, the company is already looking ahead to the fact that the next 100 or 200 million Indians who come online won't speak English. “In the last one year alone, Hindi content on the web has grown by about 94 per cent year on year, whereas English content is growing only at 19 per cent year on year,” he explains.
Last year, Google India initiated an Indian Language Internet Alliance, a group of companies who will help push regional language content online. The first set of partners in this alliance included media forms such as ABP News, Network 18 and Jagran Prakashan Ltd. The ILIA currently has 30 partner companies.
According to B.G. Mahesh, founder and MD of Oneindia.com, one of the publishers on the ILIA platform, the focus on regional languages is also essential from a marketing perspective. “Once the user base increases it becomes easier for digital companies to convince brands to spend on their platform. Brands are now interested in reaching users across India, especially Tier-2 and Tier-3 towns. What can be a better platform than Internet to reach Tier-2 and Tier-3 users at a far lesser cost than traditional media which is print and TV?” he asks.
Research conducted by various digital companies also supports the view that the character of the Internet in India is rapidly changing. “One measure is how many Facebook shares of say Hindi stories. Our data shows that it is on the same scale as English. We see creating mobile first experience and shareworthy stories for languages as a big opportunity,” says Samir Patil, CEO of Scroll media which runs the website Scroll.in. Scroll Media has already introduced Satyagrah.com, a Hindi site while others, like curated news aggregator InShorts, have also introduced Hindi versions.
Mr Mahesh also points out that it is not content companies alone that to stand to benefit. “All Internet companies stand to benefit by promoting regional languages. Users want to consume content / services in a language they are most comfortable with. Definitely services like railway booking, apparel, electronics can benefit a lot by having their sites in regional languages.” E-tailers like Snapdeal and Shopclues have already taken the lead, rolling out their sites in Hindi and Tamil versions while several others are expected to follow suit.

A survey of major banks and financial institutions on their expectations of key financial and economic variables determining financial conditions in the Indian economy has shown an improvement in the CII-IBA Financial Conditions Index to 70.3 in Q3 this fiscal year from 67.8 during the last quarter.
The index figure indicates a healthy improvement in the overall financial conditions in the Indian economy owing to expectations of leading banks and financial institutions of a reduction in cost of funds, strong liquidity position, better external financial linkages and an uptick in economic activity, according to a statement from the Indian Banks’ Association.
Thirty-six leading banks and financial institutions participated in the survey for the current quarter.
They expect the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to take note of the improvement in its monetary policy review scheduled Tuesday by further reducing interest rates.
“The scale of improvement in the financial conditions index for the current quarter will provide the necessary comfort to the RBI in continuing and further extending the accommodative monetary policy stance for supporting higher economic growth,” Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General, CII, said.

The Finance Ministry will hold a review meeting with banks and RBI representatives on Tuesday to assess >the gold monetisation scheme, which has seen a “slow response” since the launch earlier this month, so as to make it more attractive.
The meeting, to be chaired by Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das, is also likely to be attended by RBI Deputy Governor H.R. Khan, an official said.
“Banks are now in talks with institutions and temples to popularise the gold monetisation scheme. The Economic Affairs department will review the progress on December 1,” the official added.
The scheme, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 5, has received a “slow response”, according to the ministry.
Out of the 20,000 tonnes of gold worth over Rs 52 lakh crore lying idle with households and institutions, the scheme has been able to garner only 400 gm of physical gold till November 18.

Sovereign Gold Bonds




»
Proposed Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) is part of government’s budget proposal along with Gold Monetisation Scheme (GMS) 


»
While GMS proposes to ‘monetize’ India’s massive stock of physical gold, SGBs intend to convert the investment demand for physical gold into paper demand



»
If subscribed fully in the first year, SGBs could result in saving of $2 billion on gold imports at current prices 




 The scheme is aimed at reducing the country’s reliance on the gold imports to meet the domestic demand.
The ministry has recently fine-tuned the scheme to get better response from those holding stocks of gold.
It has allowed depositors to give their gold directly to the refiner without involving the collection and purity testing centres wherever it is acceptable to the banks.
“This will encourage the bulk depositors like HUFs and institutions to participate in the scheme,” the ministry had said.
It had already met the representatives of the gems and jewellery industry associations to seek their views on making the monetisation scheme attractive.
Following that, the ministry has allowed more than 13,000 BIS licensed jewellers to act as a Collection and Purity Testing Centres (CPTCs), provided they have a tie-up with BIS’s certified refiners.

India needs to grow at 8 per cent for decades so as to create the required amount of employment for the country’s working-age population, the Minister of State for Finance, Jayant Sinha, said.
“Our economic approach is fundamentally different from the previous government. We have the same philosophy as the Vajpayee government. What we are trying to do is build India’s production capacity so we can sustain high growth over long periods of time. This is a supply side view,” Mr. Sinha said while speaking at a session on removing India’s economic hurdles at the PHD Chamber’s 110th annual general meeting.
“This building of production capacity involves developing hard assets, such as roads, ports, rails connectivity, and others as well as soft assets like skills and an innovation ecosystem,” Mr. Sinha said.
There were several key concepts that underpinned the government’s philosophy on economic principles, he said.
“First and foremost, this is a pro-poor government. This is not a political necessity, but a moral responsibility. Because of this, we are also a pro-market government. How else will we create employment and generate taxes that can be used for social development,” Mr. Sinha said. A pro-market policy does not necessarily imply being pro-business. It simply means ensuring efficient market functioning, he said..
The second guiding principal, Mr. Sinha said, was one of empowerment and not entitlement and the third was one that Mr. Modi has often repeated: minimum government, maximum governance.
“Co-operative federalism is also an important aspect of this government’s philosophy. Our States are larger than more European countries. We want them to have the finances and opportunities to prosper,” Mr. Sinha said.
The Minister also outlined six ‘game-changers’ that were already in place. The first, an initiative Mr. Sinha called revolutionary, was putting in place universal social security through the JAM trinity (Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar, and Mobile). “In 100 days the government has ensured that 100 per cent of families have bank accounts and 90 per cent of MGNREGA payments are being done directly into the accounts. This is historic, revolutionary.”
The second was the various schemes and initiatives, such as the Krishi Sinchayee Yojana and providing agri-credit and crop insurance, the government has undertaken for the upliftment of farmers.
The third was in its endeavour to create employment through its Skill India mission, Mr. Sinha said. He also said that the government would soon be launching a major initiative around startups, a Startups Yojana of sorts.
“Public investment is pouring into transportation, including railways. There was virtually no capital investment in railways in the last 10 years. Now Rs.8.5 lakh crore will be investment in railways during this government’s term. Public investment in general is up 40 per cent over its levels last year,” Mr. Sinha said. Since the Modi government came to power it has given licenses to 23 new deposit-taking institutions already. “The Indradhanush revamp plan is doing more for banks than anything since nationalisation.”
Finally, the government has to do with overhaluing the fiscal architecture of the country, Mr. Sinha said. “This involves empowering the States in terms of the devolution of taxes. We have taken the devolution share from 32 per cent to 42 per cent, a change of 10 per cent. The earlier largest change was in the order of 2.5 per cent,” he said, adding that GST and the cutting of corporate tax and removal of exemptions were also very important steps being taken.
There were significant challenges facing the government as well, he said. The first, he said, had to do with the paucity of manpower in the government, an example being that there are only 4,000 IAS officers in the entire country, which works out to only 1.5 officers per district. Secondly there were several projects that span various ministries and departments in the government and coordination between them is often a big problem.
“While the government can think of targets and achievables and regular progress appraisals when it is in mission mode, like the Jan Dhan Yojana, this isn’t the case usually. Such a mindset needs to become routine in government,” Mr. Sinha said.






What is the Goods and Services Tax?





As the name suggests, it is a tax levied when a consumer buys a good or service. It is meant to be a single, comprehensive tax that will subsume all the other smaller indirect taxes on consumption like service tax, etc. This is how it is done in most developed countries.





What is preventing GST from being a reality?





A major change like GST requires a constitutional amendment, which requires a bill to passed in both houses of Parliament. The GST constitutional amendment bill was passed in the Lok Sabha in May this year.
It has been held up in the Rajya Sabha due to objections being raised by the Opposition regarding the Bill as well as issues with no direct connection to GST.
The Bill was also placed before a Rajya Sabha select committee, which made its recommendations regarding changes to the Bill. The Cabinet cleared these changes in July.





What are the Opposition’s objections?





The Congress wants a provision capping the GST rate at 18 per cent to be added to the Bill itself.
It also wants to scrap the proposed 1 per cent additional levy (over and above the GST) for manufacturing states.
This levy was demanded by manufacturing states who argued that they needed to be compensated for the investment they had made in improving their manufacturing capabilities. The Centre had agreed to this demand to encourage the states to support the GST Bill.
The third demand by the Congress was to change the composition of the GST council—the body that decides the various nitty-gritty’s like rates of tax, period of levy of additional tax, principles of supply, special provisions to certain states, etc. The proposed composition is for the Council to be two-thirds comprised from states and one-third from the Centre.
The Congress wants the Centre’s share to be reduced to one-fourth.
This demand, however, was rejected by even the Rajya Sabha Standing Committee.

A number of Indian firms are gearing up to raise funds from issuing what are known as ‘masala bonds.’ Coinciding with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent visit to the UK, organisations such as Housing Development Finance Corp., Yes Bank, and the Railways had announced they were going to raise funds through this route from the London market. Ratings agency S&P expects the issuance of masala bonds to touch $5 billion annually over the next two to three years. Here is an explainer on what masala bonds are all about:

What are masala bonds?

Bonds are instruments of debt - typically used by corporates to raise money from investors. Masala bonds have to be explained in the context of Indian corporates raising money from overseas investors. Before masala bonds, corporates have had to rely on avenues such as external commercial borrowings or ECBs. The challenge with the likes of ECBs is the entity raising money is faced with a currency risk - they have to be raised and repaid in dollar terms. A year is a long time in forex markets - currencies fluctuate sharply. So, imagine the risk a bond issuing entity, especially one with largely rupee earnings, if issue and repayment are years apart.
Enter masala bonds! They are rupee-denominated bonds issued to overseas buyers. This is how it is different from other instruments. With a masala bond, a corporate could issue Rs. 10 billion worth of bonds with the promise of paying back Rs. 11 billion in one year. But as the Indian rupee has limited convertibility, the investors will lend the dollar equivalent of the Rs. 10 billion. After one year, the Indian corporate needs to pay back the dollar equivalent of Rs. 11 billion. The currency risk is with the investor.

How did the tag masala come about?

The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the investment arm of the World Bank, issued a Rs. 1,000 crore bond in November last year. The purpose of the issue was to fund infrastructure projects in India. IFC named them ‘masala’ bonds to reflect the Indian angle to it. This kind of naming has been done before. This is, in fact, much like IFC's Chinese yuan-denominated Dim sum bonds. It isn't unusual in the foreign bonds market to encounter names such as Yankee and Bulldog. By the way, Japanese yen-denominated bonds are called Samurai. There was even much speculation about what the rupee-denominated bonds would be called before 'masala' was confirmed. Samosa, Ganga, and Peacock were apparently some of the names doing the rounds.

What has been the regulator's stance on this?

The Reserve Bank of India has issued guidelines allowing Indian companies, non-banking finance companies (HDFC, India Bulls Housing Finance are examples of such companies) and infrastructure investment trusts and real investment trusts (investment vehicles that pool money from various investors and invest in infrastructure and real estate sectors) to issue rupee-denominated bond overseas.
The rules put the issue limit to $750 million and also has a pricing cap for various tenures of issue. Experts say the move to permit masala bonds is an attempt to increase the international status of rupee and is also a step toward full currency convertibility (the freedom to convert Indian currency into other internationally accepted currency without any restrictions).

Why should investors look at masala bonds?

The Finance Ministry has cut the withholding tax (a tax deducted at source on residents outside the country) on interest income of such bonds to 5 per cent from 20 per cent, making it attractive for investors. Also, capital gains from rupee appreciation are exempted from tax.
Globally, there is ample liquidity thanks to lower interest rates in developed markets, but there are very few investment options due to weak economic conditions globally. India is that rare fast-growing large economy, and masala bonds is one way for investors to take advantage of this.
By the way, these bonds are bought by retail investors as well as big institutions overseas.

What do masala bonds mean to the issuer?

An important consideration for issuers is the access to cheaper funding than what's available in the domestic markets, according to ratings firm S&P. For corporates, who would be the main issuers, masala bonds will be one other key source of funding apart from banks and local debt markets. Another ratings firm India Ratings and Research says such bonds would lower the cost of capital over a period of time - the cost remains one of the highest in Asia. This also makes sense given that Indian banks are reluctant to lend to sectors facing weak demand and heavy debt.

Is there anything investors need to worry about?

Investors would need to keenly watch the credibility of the issuer. For example, it would easy for an HDFC or NTPC to easy to raise the bond when compared to a smaller firm. Higher the credit rating of a firm, the better would be the appetite for their issues. Since the currency risk is on the investors, they will like the rupee to be stable. S&P says the initial excitement over masala bonds will give way to the ultimate realisation that because currency and economic growth are external factors, investors will subject issuers to a lot more scrutiny.

The word 'startups' made its way explicitly in to the Indian budget lexicon only last year. And then, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his 
>Independence Day speech
 announced a new campaign — 
>Startup India; Stand up India
 — to promote entrepreneurship. The eyes of the startup community is now set on the likely unveiling of rules in January that would, they hope, make it easy for young ventures to do business in India.
An enabling environment for startups is a long-standing demand of the community. This year, 75 per cent of young tech ventures that are funded have domiciled in Singapore, the U.S and the U.K., because of better regulatory environment.
It isn't just the Government at the Centre that is talking startups. Recently, Telangana 
>launched what is called the T-Hub, India's 
>largest technology incubator. The facility is 
>almost completely booked
, having attracted over 130 startups from across India. It has also tied-up with 20 venture capitalists, and is in talks with the University of Texas, MIT Media Lab, Incubio of Spain, and laboratories and academic institutions in India for collaboration.
In October, Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi met 
>with over twenty startup founders
 (including those of online grocery retailer BigBasket, home healthcare firm Portea and Stayzilla, an online marketplace providing hotel stays) to understand the issues faced by them in Karnataka. In order to maintain Bengaluru's edge as the startup capital of India, Karnataka is coming up with incentives for startups in the form of tax-breaks and easy access to venture capital.
But the upcoming policies of the Centre should matter the most. It aims to spur innovation by creating incubation facilities and encouraging students to take up entrepreneurship. Experts say the government wants to make a difference not only to new-age firms but small companies as well to create jobs. The initiatives are likely to include tax write-offs, relaxation of rules for venture capital flows and rules that make it easy for startups to shut down. Also, the government is planning to streamline the patent process and set up incubation centres.
“It would be very important if it stops exodus of startups and our innovation index improves,” says Sharad Sharma, cofounder of software product think tank iSpirt. “Only time will tell whether it will matter.”
The previous government in 2011 had announced the 
>India Inclusive Innovation Fund
, headed by telecom czar Sam Pitroda. Its aim was to provide capital to new ventures that serve the needs of India's low-income communities. But the fund, whose eventual size was envisaged at more than Rs 5,000 crore, is 
>still in the process
 of conceptualisation, design and development.
When the rules are out in January, India will be likely emulating a model followed by countries such as US, Israel and China, where the government is an active supporter of the country's startups with funds and friendly policies
The starting point will be something far more basic, though. “To begin with, it will come up with the definition of a startup,” said a person who is helping the government in this initiative and who does not want to be quoted. For the government, all the small firms are ‘startups” including new-age tech companies, small traditional companies as well as millions of self-employed people who are running their business. The definition is important so that someone opening a “flour mill” cannot claim benefits. So, what's a startup? We will know soon.

The government, in a bid to bolster the impact of the Skill India mission, is mapping the country’s existing training infrastructure, including thousands of private training institutes that are thriving but do not reflect in the official data.
New enterprise- and household-level statistical surveys to be conducted by the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) would now glean details about training institutions, their capacities for imparting different skill sets and their utilisation by young job market aspirants.
The government runs about 12,000 industrial training institutes and has direct access to data on their operations and outcomes, but that information is inadequate to assess the actual training capacity in the country, said a senior official in the National Skill Development Agency (NSDA).
“Skill development capacities created through government funded programmes is only a part of the story. The capacity created by private investment is unknown,” said the official.
The NSDA, an arm of the skill development and entrepreneurship ministry, had requested the NSSO under the statistics ministry to incorporate new questions to capture these details into their household and enterprise surveys.
“Once this is done the shortfall in capacity can be gauged and a plan for bridging the gap can be formulated and implemented,” the official said. He said there was a need for creating an inventory of skilling sets.
In July, while launching the Skill India Mission, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that India would be the biggest supplier of workforce to the world in the coming years as it had a huge pool of people who were young.
“We should not just map the demand for human resources in India but also globally, and gear up to meet that demand,” Mr. Modi said.

Major construction equipment makers are bullish about the Union government’s focus on road and highway sector, water revitalisation and other infrastructure projects and additional reforms are expected to act as a catalyst.
Recently, Union Minister for road transport, highways and shipping Nitin Gadkari announced his plans to increase the length of national highways to 1,50,000 km from the present 96,000 km including expressways. The government has also set a target of constructing 30 km of National Highways a day. The government has also announced four major corridor development projects such as the Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor, Amritsar-Kolkata, Vizag-Chennai and Bangalore-Mumbai.
The Indian construction equipment industry is expected to grow to $5 billion by 2019-20, according to a report released by Indian construction equipment manufacturers association (ICEMA), The current market size of the construction equipment including backhoe loader, concrete mixers excavator is around $2.8 billion.
“The government has cleared certain road and port projects and the work of these would begin next year. Our expectations are that with the market growing the demand for our devices will also grow,” said Sandeep Singh, Managing Director, Tata Hitachi, a joint venture between Tata and Japan’s Hitachi. For FY 17, the company expects a growth of 15 per cent in business as against the present 5-6 per cent. Major contractors have replaced their old equipment anticipating growth in the sector. This has also contributed to the optimism of the device manufacturers. Tata Motors said its commercial vehicles, medium and heavy trucks, which is both cargo and ConsTruck has seen a growth of about 30 per cent and 8 per cent year-on-year, respectively. “Government policies on infrastructure development, will lead to better utilisation. We foresee double digit growth in the sector, going forward,” said Rajesh Kaul, Business Head, Intermediate, Medium & Heavy Trucks, Tata Motors.
Anticipating growth in the market both Indian players and global players such as Diamler, Scania, JCB, Volvo, among others has also introduced new devices and machinery to the market. However, these majors say, most of the manufacturing facilities are currently running underutilised.
“Government will need to be a key enabler for the construction equipment industry to grow while uniform and simplified taxation along with benefits could help promote global practices such as used equipment, leasing and rental business,” said V. Ravichandar, Chairman and Managing Director, Feedback Business Consulting.

India, at the forthcoming Nairobi meeting of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), will put “all its energies” on pushing through a plan meant to protect the interests and livelihood of poor and vulnerable farmers, government officials who didn’t want to be identified told The Hindu.
Roberto Azevedo, WTO Director General, recently said that the negotiations to firm up rules to liberalise global trade are currently “stuck” due to member countries finding it “difficult to reconcile their views” on a host of issues.
The Indian position echoed the one recently proposed by the G-33 on an effective Special Safeguard Mechanism (SSM). The G33 is a coalition of 48 nations including India, Indonesia and China, which took up the issue of developing countries getting considerable flexibility in limiting market opening of agriculture sector.
The SSM is a trade remedy that would allow developing countries to temporarily hike import duties on farm products to counter sudden import surges and price falls, thereby, protecting the interests of poor farmers. The same issue had led to the breakdown of a WTO ministerial meeting in July 2008.
It has been generally agreed that the developing countries could have an SSM, but developed countries including the US have opposed a proposal to enable developing countries to raise tariffs (using SSM) over and above the duty commitments made by them (developing countries) in the farm sector during the earlier Uruguay Round of WTO global trade pact negotiations. The Uruguay Round took place before the current Doha Round talks that began in 2001. The new SSM proposal was to include provisions to empower developing countries to impose additional duties (temporarily) on agriculture products when their imports breach specified ceilings on price or volume
India wants this SSM proposal to be taken up on a “high priority-basis” during the WTO ministerial meeting at Nairobi (Kenya) slated to start on December 15, official sources said “There will not be any compromise on this (SSM) issue as it involves protection of poor farmers, which is of course a politically sensitive matter. It has to be given priority at the Kenya meet,” an official said.
However, the developed world, including the US, European Union, Australia, along with leading agriculture producer and exporter Brazil, has expressed their disagreement with the proposal. The negotiations are over the extent to which different categories of (developing) countries will be allowed to hike duties (using the SSM) beyond their 'bound tariff' -- or the duty ceiling as per their WTO commitments.
Official sources said the developing countries including India had, during recent discussions at the WTO, wanted an “effective” SSM for “addressing volatilities and instabilities causing import surges and price depressions.” The developing nations added that if these import surges and price depressions were “not immediately and effectively addressed as they occur, (they would) undermine poverty reduction efforts, livelihood and food security, and rural development in WTO Members.”
The volatility in global prices of agricultural items, the developing countries claim, is caused by many factors, including huge subsidies given to the farm sector in developed countries. Developing countries members, including India, said that therefore, an effective SSM was “very important” for them. The developed countries instead want discussions on SSM to be linked to the issue of greater market access in farm products, the sources said. Another item that India wants to be taken up on priority at the Nairobi meeting is that of arriving at a permanent solution to the issue of public food stockholding in developing countries for the purpose of food security.

The Centre has formed a council, to be represented by officials from the Central and state governments, experts and exporters, to look into the various aspects of the granite industry.
To be headed by the Mines Secretary it will be called as the ‘Development Council for Granite Industry.’
The first meeting of the council will take place in New Delhi on December 1.
“The constitution of the council fulfils the long felt need of the industry. Based on our suggestions, various sub committees will be formed soon for the betterment of the industry,” said R. Veeramani, Chairman, granite and natural stone panel of Chemicals and Allied Export Promotion Council, Ministry of Commerce.
According to him, the council will also look into aspects such as competition from lesser known countries, issues relating to technology upgradation, sourcing of adequate material for existing factories and to improve volumes.
Declining exports
For the last six months, India reported a decline in its exports of natural stones, marbles and granite due to factors such as recession, currency depreciation, dumping of cheap materials by China, entry of new players and restrictive policies of the State government regarding prospecting and long-term mining leases.
“Falling granite exports and non-uniform policies adopted by various state governments are hurting us badly. These are some of the burning issues, which we would like to place it before the council for betterment of the industry.
The Centre and the state government should come out with a globalised approach to seize the increasing demand for these products in the global market. Else, we will be losing our position to China and lesser known countries,” he said.

India’s biggest biotech firm Biocon Ltd. expects revenue to double to $1 billion in four years as it expands in Europe and the U.S. with new products, its chairperson and Managing Director said on Saturday.
In a tie-up with U.S. generic drugmaker Mylan NV, the Bangalore-based biopharmaceutical firm has five biosimilar products — almost identical copies of original drugs — entering global regulatory approval stage which is expected to take about 18-20 months.
“We forecast that by financial year 2019 our revenues will be $1 billion with 25 per cent coming from research and 75 per cent from rest of our business,” Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw told Reuters on a business visit to Abu Dhabi.
Biocon’s revenues were a little less than $500 million for fiscal 2014-15, she said.
Of the 70 per cent of the products that it exports, the U.S and Europe account for 50 per cent.
Biocon has invested over $200 million in research and development to develop biosimilars at its Malaysia facility, currently in its commissioning phase, she said.
The firm has lost business in some Middle East markets due to turmoil in the region, particularly Syria where Biocon had high sales.
Sales in Lebanon, Egypt and Iran also fell but there were signs of recovery in Egypt, said Ms. Shaw, who started Biocon out of a garage in 1978 in Bangalore.
She declined to give specific sales figures for Syria or the other Middle East markets. The Middle East and north Africa markets account for about 6 per cent of Biocon’s exports. To offset those markets, Biocon has been focusing through aggressive marketing in north African markets such as Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia as well as markets in central and south-east Asia and Latin America.
Ms. Shaw also said Biocon could divest further in its research and manufacturing arm Syngene in 2016 once the latter reaches strong growth.
“It won’t happen this fiscal, we are looking at next year,” she said without giving details.

After giving a booster dose of 50-basis point rate cut at its last meet, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to keep key policy rates unchanged on Tuesday, adopting a wait-and-watch approach ahead of the Fed meeting amid concerns over inflation that has been inching up in the last three months.
“I think Raghuram Rajan will wait for the Fed move. He will not change the rates,” UCO Bank Managing Director and Chief Executive, R. K. Takkar, said.
Another State-run lender United Bank’s Executive Director Sanjay Arya said he also expects a status quo on Tuesday.
“There are concerns about inflation and I don’t think there is going to be any change. Mr. Rajan is likely to hold rates this time,” he said, however, adding in the long-term the rates have to come down due to dis-inflationary pressure. Moreover, analysts at American brokerages Citi and Bank of America Merrill Lynch also ruled out any surprise this time.
“We expect Mr. Rajan to pause on Tuesday, given the 50 bps surprise cut last time. He should cut a final 25 basis points in February,” according to a statement from BofA-ML.
Citi echoed similar views saying “following the 50 bps front-loading in September, RBI will maintain status quo on Tuesday as significant uncertainty exists ahead of December Fed and the upcoming Budget.” Industry body Assocham also expects the apex bank to keep the benchmark rate unchanged with global factors influencing its stance.
“Fast changing geopolitical situation in the Middle East and the increased terror threat with consequent economic costs will surely weigh on the RBI’s policy stance which is not expected to give any more cut in the interest rates in the ensuing review,” it pointed out.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to affect its first hike in nearly a decade at its two-day meeting from December 16. The US repo rate has been at 0-0.25 per cent since the 2008 global credit crisis.
Some marketmen feel retail inflation, which inched up to 5 per cent in October remains a worry. CPI stood at 4.41 per cent in September and 4.62 per cent in October. In the last policy, RBI had said inflation was expected to reach 5.8 per cent by January 2016. Experts said the central bank is now likely to reduce rates in February after the Budget announcement.
While BofA-ML sees a 25 bps cut in February, Citi said it sees a 25-50 bps rate easing through 2016.

With the Indian consumer spending more during the festival season and demanded more cash, this has pushed up the short term money market rates. This is happening at a time when interest rates are supposed to soften since the central bank is reducing its policy rate.
As a result, banks are expecting the central bank to provide some comfort by infusing more money into the banking system in the fifth bimonthly monetary policy review scheduled 1 December.
Typically, there are outflows to the tune of Rs 50,000 crore during the festival season but this year the amount was 15-20 per cent higher. “This has resulted in the call money rates moving over 7 per cent mark on some days,” said a dealer.
Bankers said since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has taken an accommodative monetary policy stance and reduced policy interest rate by 125 bps in 2015 – which is now at 6.25 per cent – it could address the liquidity issue by pumping in more money into the system by open market purchase of bonds.
The central bank aims the overnight rate to hover around the repo rate which is 6.75 per cent.
Apart from increased consumer spending, government’s cash balances with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also increased – meaning the government is spending less as compared to what it did during the first half of the financial year – hence lesser amount of cash is coming to the system.
Foreign investors are also pulling out the country and investing in lesser risky assets with the US Fed is believed to be on course for a rate hike in December. “Liquidity has become somewhat tighter due to the outflows, which has also put pressure on rupee,” said Hariprasad M. P. Senior Vice President & Head – Treasury & Banknotes Business with Centrum Direct. (End)

Multiplex chain operator PVR expects to add at least 23 screens in the current financial year to take the total to 500 in the same fiscal.
“Our target is to reach 1,000 screens quickly. The shorter target is to get to 500 screens in this financial year and then look at going to 1,000 screens,” PVR Cinemas Chief Operating Officer Gautam Dutta told PTI in Mumbai.
PVR currently operates 477 screens across 44 cities in the country.
It has four brands across different price points — PVR Talkies, PVR Cinemas, PVR Premium and newly launched PVR Icon.
Mr. Dutta said the new screens will largely be in PVR Cinemas and PVR Premium.
The company has a capex of Rs. 200 crore this fiscal, which includes Rs. 135-140 crore for new projects and the remaining for renovation and the cost of each new screen is around Rs. 2-2.5 crore.
It recently launched the PVR Icon brand, which is an ultra-premium category, at one of its multiplexes at a suburban mall here with an investment of Rs. 25 crore, Mr. Dutta said, adding that they will be launching PVR Icon in Bengaluru and Pune in the next fiscal, taking the total to three properties under the newly-created brand.
The company would be spending Rs. 60-70 lakh on marketing for the new brand PVR Icon.
PVR enjoys an occupancy rate of 35-37 per cent, with a reported footfall of 66 million.
Online sales contribute around 35-36 per cent of the total ticket earnings.
Food and beverages contribute 25 per cent of the revenues, while advertising accounts for 12 per cent of the income. The company’s consolidated revenue for FY15 stood at Rs. 1,486 crore.
On acquisition, he said, “We don’t see much. Whatever had to be acquired, it got acquired. There will always be consolidation which is happening but the larger players have all settled and I think it is going to remain like this for a little while now.”
“We are all open (to acquisition). Some of the players that we knew who were wanting to acquire or wanting to sell, largely some trading has happened within the industry, some consolidation, there could be a few more but we feel that the time has come where the industry will settle down and move.”
In June, PVR acquired real estate major DLF’s DT Cinemas for Rs. 500 crore.
In January, Mexican multiplex chain operator Cinepolis fully acquired Essel Group’s Fun Cinemas.
In December 2014, Carnival Group acquired Big Cinemas from Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group for an estimated Rs. 700 crore, making it the biggest deal in this sector.
In July 2014, Inox had acquired Gurgaon-based rival Satyam Cineplexes in a Rs. 182-crore deal to strengthen its presence in north India.
It also bought multiplex cinema theatre firm Fame India and Calcutta Cinema Private (CCPL) in West Bengal.
In 2012, PVR acquired Cinemax for Rs. 395 crore.

Tata Communications Payment Solutions that runs the Indicash brand of white-label ATMs as well as brown-label cash vending machines, feels the era of bank-run ATMs will soon be history as the industry has almost fully moved to third-party run operations mode.
The Tata Group enjoys over 60 per cent market share in the white-label ATM space with over 7,000 machines installed in 20 states, while its brown-label machines count over 13,000 as of now.
Out of these 7,000, as many as 4,000 are in fully unbanked areas. Together the company enjoys over 10 per cent market share in the 2 lakh ATMs market in the country, out of which 1.9 lakh are brown-label machines. The company’s white label ATM count nearly doubled in the past one year alone.
At present, there are 11,000 white-label machines installed by the three operators who got permission from the Reserve Bank to run such machines two years ago. White-label ATMs are those run by companies like Tata Communications, Muthoot Finance and Prism Payment Services and are available for any bank, while brown-label machines are those owned and branded by banks, but could be operated and maintained by third party operators like the Tata company.
“Since the past one year or so there has not been many contracts coming in from banks for installing ATMs, especially from the private sector players, which have not installed any single machine on their own. Even the government-owned banks are not doing any great numbers. And I feel if the trend continues, which is more likely than not, soon brown-label ATMs will become history. To me it seems that we will also soon be following the rest of the world in this regard”, Tata Communications Payment Solutions chief executive Sanjeev Patel told PTI in an interview here.
He argued that it makes no sense for a bank to install ATMs on its own now. For one, installing and running these machines on own is too costly for a bank. Secondly, there are many other ways to build brands in this era, he said, adding on an average a white-label ATM costs just around Rs 5 lakh, while a brown-label one costs many times more as rentals play a big role in the cost.
